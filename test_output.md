## Summary

This document constitutes Part Two of a comprehensive analysis of financial shenanigans, specifically focusing on Earnings Manipulation (EM). It introduces seven distinct categories of EM shenanigans used by dishonest corporate executives to misrepresent company performance and manipulate declared earnings. The primary objective of this section is to help skeptical investors identify these tricks to avoid financial losses. The text categorizes these manipulations into two subgroups: those that inflate current-period earnings and those that inflate future-period earnings (often for the purpose of earnings smoothing).

The core of the document is Chapter 3, which details 'Shenanigan No. 1: Recording Revenue Too Soon.' This chapter explores various creative and often fraudulent techniques used to accelerate revenue recognition. These include 'calendar games' like stretching months beyond 30 or 31 days, recording revenue before completing material contract obligations, and recognizing sales before final buyer acceptance. The text emphasizes that while these schemes may temporarily boost stock prices and executive compensation, they ultimately lead to massive losses and regulatory action when discovered.

Through numerous high-profile case studies—including MicroStrategy, Computer Associates, Sunbeam, Keurig Green Mountain, and Valeant—the document illustrates the warning signs of aggressive accounting. Key indicators for investors include 'boomerang' transactions, suspicious timing of press releases, changes in revenue recognition policies (such as switching from 'sell-through' to 'sell-in'), and spikes in 'days sales outstanding' (DSO). The analysis concludes that investors must look beyond quarterly earnings releases and scrutinize 10-K and 10-Q footnotes to detect these deceptive practices.

## Key Points

- Earnings manipulation is categorized into seven main shenanigans, with the first five aimed at inflating current earnings and the last two at smoothing or shifting earnings.
- Shenanigan No. 1 involves recording revenue too soon through techniques like 'calendar games' (e.g., Computer Associates' 35-day months).
- 'Boomerang' transactions, where money flows in a circle between seller and customer, are a major red flag for illegitimate revenue recognition.
- Changes in revenue recognition policies, such as moving from 'sell-through' to 'sell-in' or from delivery to shipment, are often used to mask slowing growth.
- Percentage-of-Completion (POC) accounting provides significant latitude for management to pull forward revenue by manipulating cost estimates.
- Investors should closely monitor 'Days Sales Outstanding' (DSO); a sharp increase often indicates aggressive revenue recognition or poor cash management.
- Bill-and-hold arrangements and consignment sales are frequently abused to record revenue before a true sale to an end user has occurred.
- Management may use 'side letter' agreements to void sales if customers fail to receive funding, yet still record the revenue prematurely.
- Scrutinizing footnotes in 10-K and 10-Q filings is essential, as these often contain the only disclosure of critical accounting policy changes.

# PART TWO: EARNINGS MANIPULATION SHENANIGANS

Investors rely on the information that they receive from companies to make informed and rational securities selection decisions. This information is assumed to be accurate, whether the news is good or bad. While most corporate executives respect investors and their needs, some dishonest ones hurt investors by misrepresenting the actual company performance and manipulating the company’s declared earnings. Part Two fleshes out the seven categories of Earnings Manipulation (EM) Shenanigans and suggests how skeptical investors can ferret out these tricks to avoid losses.

**EARNINGS MANIPULATION SHENANIGANS**
* **EM Shenanigan No. 1:** Recording revenue too soon (Chapter 3)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 2:** Recording bogus revenue (Chapter 4)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 3:** Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities (Chapter 5)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 4:** Shifting current expenses to a later period (Chapter 6)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 5:** Employing other techniques to hide expenses or losses (Chapter 7)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 6:** Shifting current income to a later period (Chapter 8)
* **EM Shenanigan No. 7:** Shifting future expenses to the current period (Chapter 9)

Management may use a variety of techniques to give investors the mistaken impression that the company is performing better than the underlying economic reality. We have categorized all these earnings manipulation tricks into two major subgroups: inflating current-period earnings and inflating future-period earnings.

## Inflating Current-Period Earnings

Quite simply, to inflate current-period earnings, management must either push more revenue or gains into the current period or shift expenses to a later one. Shenanigans Nos. 1, 2, and 3 push revenue or one-time gains into current-period operations, and Nos. 4 and 5 shift expenses to a later period.

## Inflating Future-Period Earnings

Conversely, to inflate tomorrow’s operations, management would simply hold back today’s revenue or gains and accelerate tomorrow’s expenses or losses into the current period. Shenanigan No. 6 describes techniques to improperly hold back revenue, and Shenanigan No. 7 accelerates expenses into an incorrect earlier period.

Earnings can be inflated by inappropriately including revenues or gains and by excluding rightful expenses or losses of that period. Conversely, earnings can be deflated by inappropriately excluding revenues or gains of that period and by including expenses or losses that really pertain to another period. Of course, a scheme to deflate current-period earnings pays off when those benefits are released into a later period.

Of the seven categories of Earnings Manipulation Shenanigans, the first five serve to inflate earnings, and the last two serve to lower profits. For most readers, the use of Shenanigans Nos. 1 through 5 to exaggerate earnings might seem more logical or intuitive. After all, higher reported profits often lead to a higher stock price and higher executive compensation. The logic of using Shenanigans Nos. 6 and 7 may be less obvious, but they do serve a purpose. These schemes serve to shift earnings from one period (with excess profits) to another (in need of profits). Put differently, management may simply be attempting to smooth out volatile earnings to portray a less volatile business.

# 3 Earnings Manipulation Shenanigan No. 1: Recording Revenue Too Soon

Thirty days has September,
April, June, and November;
Of twenty-eight there is but one,
And all the rest have thirty-one.
—A MODERN VERSION OF THE FIFTEENTH-CENTURY MEDIEVAL BRITISH RHYME

As young children, many of us were taught this useful rhyme to help remember the number of days in each month. Frankly, it still comes in handy as a reminder well into our adult years. It was much later in life though when we realized that February was not necessarily the only exception to the 30- or 31-day rule. In fact, every month could be the exception for a company that wishes to inflate its revenue. Computer Associates (CA) had become the poster child for this revenue inflation trick, regularly stretching out its months to 35 days on the books in order to capture sales booked after the conventional month-end. That scheme worked well for a while—or at least until the company was caught and CEO Sanjay Kumar was sent to jail.

Stretching out the number of days in a month is but one of the creative techniques that management may use to improperly record revenue too early. This chapter describes a variety of ways in which management attempts to accelerate revenue to earlier periods and how investors can spot signs of this transgression.

## Techniques to Record Revenue Too Soon

1. Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract
2. Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract
3. Recording revenue before the buyer’s final acceptance of the product
4. Recording revenue when the buyer’s payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

## 1. Recording Revenue Before Completing Material Obligations Under the Contract



### Riding the Tech Wave at Microstrategy

Who could forget the raging Internet-driven bull market during the late 1990s (with the Nasdaq Index up 94 percent in 1999) and the almost-anything-goes accounting practices used to fuel the stratospheric growth of many tech companies? Perhaps the poster child for this crazy period would be Virginia-based software seller MicroStrategy (MSTR). In less than two years after going public, its market value reached $25 billion, a staggering 60-fold increase. A key driver of its growth, it turns out, was a practice of recording sales to parties that MicroStrategy had recently invested in. While it’s impossible to know for sure whether these were in fact sham transactions, the fact pattern raised serious suspicion. In addition to these questionable sales, MSTR pushed customers to sign contracts just before quarter-end, believing that the signing of a contract was the key event to permit recording revenue. As we will discuss later, revenue is recognized when earned, that is, when services have been performed.

### Living a Dream—and a Nightmare

Imagine living the American dream during the Internet era. You and your college buddy create a software company. For the first few years, you work around the clock, but you take virtually no cash compensation. Instead, you reward yourself and your valued employees with stock and stock options. You begin meeting with investment bankers to plan your much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO). Then it happens—the bankers successfully peddle your shares to the public. You now have your first few million. But that’s only the beginning. The share price of your (now public) company begins to levitate wildly, you become one of the wealthiest people in America, and at age 34, you are not even old enough to run for the presidency. The media treat you like royalty.

This was the real-life dream of MicroStrategy’s founder, Michael Saylor. Founded in 1989, MSTR went public in 1998 at a market valuation over $200 million. That was only the beginning of an incredible odyssey. In the last four months of 1999, the share price began to rise dramatically, from $20 to over $100. Over the next 10 weeks, the stock soared incredibly to $333. Michael Saylor’s net worth reached an almost inconceivable $14 billion.

Then the dream turned into a nightmare of epic proportions. On March 20, 2000, MSTR disclosed to investors that its financial reports contained material accounting irregularities. The financial reports for 1997 to 1999 had to be restated, resulting in massive losses, rather than the previously reported profits. Shocked investors started dumping the stock, dropping the share price $140 (from $226 to $86) in a single day. But that was only the beginning. It didn’t bottom out until reaching $1.75 twelve months later. (The share price continued declining through 2002, at which point the company announced a 1-for-10 reverse split [effectively pushing its share price up 10-fold] to avoid being delisted from the stock exchange.)

### What Led to the Collapse?

In early March 2000, only weeks after its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), had blessed MSTR’s 1999 financial reports (contained in a prospectus for a proposed stock offering), Forbes magazine broke the story that raised troubling questions about the company’s revenue recognition practices.

After the Forbes article, PwC then conducted an internal investigation and concluded that the company’s audited financial reports indeed were false and misleading. The auditor’s swift about-face, an extremely rare event, sent the share price into a free fall.

### Warning Signs for Investors Found in Odd Press Releases

On October 5, 1999, MSTR announced in a press release that it had signed a deal with NCR Corporation. In the release, MSTR described a $52.5 million licensing agreement and a partnership with NCR Corporation. Under the agreement, MSTR invested in an NCR partnership, and NCR returned the favor and purchased MSTR’s products. When money flows in both directions, from seller (MSTR) to customer (NCR) and then from customer to seller, we call it a “boomerang” transaction. As the press release put it:

> Under the terms of the partnership, NCR signed a $27.5 million OEM [original equipment manufacturer] agreement for MicroStrategy’s products and personal information services. In addition, MicroStrategy has chosen to purchase an NCR Teradata Warehouse worth $11 million to power the Strategy.com network.

As part of the OEM agreement, NCR will become a master affiliate of Strategy.com. As a master affiliate, NCR will join the network, sell Strategy.com affiliations, and sell MicroStrategy products and services. As part of the agreement, MicroStrategy will provide NCR’s future OLAP technology. MicroStrategy has agreed to purchase NCR’s TeraCube business and all related intellectual property in exchange for $14 million in MicroStrategy stock.

Then just after the December 1999 quarter ended, on January 6, 2000, MSTR sent out another press release (excerpts shown below), also including a suspicious “boomerang” payment scheme that contributed to reported revenue, likely in the preceding period.

> Under the terms of the agreement, Exchange Applications will pay MicroStrategy an initial $30 million fee, payable through the combination of cash and Exchange Applications stock, of which approximately one-third will be recognized by MicroStrategy as revenue during the fourth quarter of 1999. In addition, MicroStrategy can earn up to an additional $35 million for future eCRM applications over the next two to three years. As part of the agreement, Exchange Applications will become a master affiliate of Strategy.com. As a master affiliate, Exchange Applications will join the network, sell Strategy.com affiliations, and sell MicroStrategy products and services.

### Key Lessons for Investors

Two important lessons can be gleaned from the MicroStrategy story: (1) Funds flowing back and forth between a customer and seller should raise suspicions about the legitimacy of both transactions, and (2) the suspicious timing of press releases announcing new sales (just after a period ended) should raise questions about whether revenue might have been recognized too early. Indeed, as we learned from other sources, MSTR regularly rushed to have sales contracts signed and dated just before a period ended, with the goal of accelerating revenue into that earlier period. We believe that from an accounting perspective such efforts were all for naught, as revenue should be recognized when earned, not at the point of signing a contract.

## Calendar Games

Imagine if you could place a bet on a horse race after the race ends. That sounds ridiculous; since you already would know the results beforehand, naturally, you would always win. Well, that approach reminds us of companies in jeopardy of “losing”—that is, failing to meet Wall Street’s consensus estimates—those companies that at quarter-end stretch out the end date (like CA using 35 days) to ensure that they also always win by closing their books only after reaching the desired sales and profits.

### Be Wary of Companies That Extend Their Quarter-End Date

CA was not alone in improperly inflating revenue by keeping the books open beyond the prescribed quarter-end. During the mid-1990s, “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap and his minions at Sunbeam changed the company’s quarter-end from March 29 to March 31 to make up for a revenue shortfall. The two additional days permitted Sunbeam to record another $5 million in sales from its core operations and $15 million more from its recently acquired Coleman Corporation.

Not to be outdone by CA and Sunbeam, San Diego–based software maker Peregrine also routinely kept its books open well after the official quarter ended. The practice became so common at the company that officers joked about this ploy, characterizing these late transactions as having been completed on “the thirty-seventh of December.”

## Changing Accounting Policies to Keep the Streak Alive

As we discussed earlier, when senior executives boast about an amazing record streak of performance, it is more likely that they will resort to financial shenanigans to keep that streak alive.

Consider how the popular coffee seller Keurig Green Mountain (Keurig) tried to hide its slowing revenue growth from investors. The company whimsically changed its decision rules on when recognition begins and where large-quantity rebates get categorized on the Income Statement. Keurig was growing very fast in the 2005–2008 period, and CEO Lawrence J. Blanford, proud of this achievement, regularly boasted to investors in Earnings Releases:

> It is great to be sharing such favorable results again this today. 2007 was a year of strong financial returns with net sales and earnings increasing 52% over the prior year. It was Green Mountain Coffee’s 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales growth and eighth consecutive quarter with growth in excess of 25%.

As we know, compounding anything at over 25 percent for a long time produces pretty big numbers. In the case of sales growth, it would be virtually impossible that a streak at that elevated level could be sustained. So it would be only a matter of time before Keurig would have to either announce that the streak had ended or figure out a way to make it appear that the streak had continued. Unfortunately, Keurig chose the latter approach. Reading the company’s 10-K filings for fiscal 2007 and 2008, we came across two subtle (but important) accounting policy changes that management made in 2008 to inflate revenue. First, the company began to recognize some revenue earlier in the sales process—at the point of shipment, rather than delivery. Second, it started to treat incentives or “rebates” to customers as an operating expense rather than a reduction of sales.

**KEURIG GREEN MOUNTAIN FOOTNOTES DESCRIBING ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY**
* **10-K 2007—**Revenue from wholesale and consumer direct sales is recognized upon product delivery. In addition, the Company’s customers can earn certain incentives, which are netted against sales in the consolidated income statements. [Italics added for emphasis]
* **10-K 2008—**Revenue from wholesale and consumer direct sales is recognized upon product delivery, and in some cases upon product shipment. In addition, the Company’s customers can earn certain incentives, which are netted against sales or recorded in operating and selling expenses in the consolidated income statements. [Italics added for emphasis]

## 2. Recording Revenue Far in Excess of Work Completed on the Contract

The first section illustrated how companies improperly recognize revenue by recording sales before significant activities by the seller even take place. Next, we discuss revenue recognition when the seller has started to deliver on the contract; however, management records revenue in a far greater amount than is warranted.

### Changing Revenue Recognition Policy to Record Revenue Sooner (and Greater Amounts)

Like Keurig, companies can also change their revenue recognition policy for ongoing projects to inflate sales and operating profits. Consider the plight of Japanese manufacturer Ulvac when its business struggled mightily and management considered ways to “solve” its problems by changing its accounting policies.

### Watch for a Change in Revenue Recognition Policy to Hide Collapsing Business

What to do when your business is collapsing and you hope to hide that fact from investors? In 2010, Ulvac found a very clever solution, but it involved an outrageous financial shenanigan. Table 3-1 shows the audited results Ulvac reported for the fiscal years ended June 2008, 2009, and 2010.

After a rocky 2009 (with sales plummeting 7 percent and operating profits declining 62 percent), 2010 looked like a successful turnaround period (with sales growth improving to just negative 1 percent and operating profits jumping an impressive 38 percent). It certainly appeared that the company had done an excellent job in managing costs in a period of no top-line growth. The problem, however, was that the 2010 results were woefully misleading. Specifically, Ulvac had just changed its revenue recognition approach to percentage-of-completion (POC), and as a result, it began booking sales much earlier than it would with its traditional approach. Table 3-2 shows the results Ulvac would have reported, assuming no change in revenue recognition policies. Sobering and shocking results for investors.

Notice in the right-hand column, “Adjusted Percent Change” in 2010, and compare with the change shown Table 3-1—a decline in sales of 1 percent. Rather than sales basically stabilizing in 2010, after a 7 percent decline the prior year, sales would have plummeted 21 percent, completely freaking out investors. So in order to avoid that disappointment, Ulvac’s management found a solution, and its auditors inexplicably approved—changing its revenue recognition policy and hiding its big problems from investors.

### Changing Estimates and Assumptions When Using POC Accounting

Ulvac provides an illustration of the dramatic jump in reported revenue when a company switches from standard revenue recognition practices to the more aggressive POC approach. Investors also should be alert for companies using POC that simply change some key estimates or assumptions, as those actions can also materially inflate revenue.

Consider solar energy leader First Solar (FSLR) and its accounting changes to hide business setbacks from investors. In 2014, FSLR was building out some of the largest solar-powered power plants in the United States. Since these were long-term construction projects, First Solar applied percentage-of-completion accounting, and it determined the proportion of progress on each contract by calculating the costs incurred on the project as a percentage of the total expected costs. Under this method, any changes in the company’s estimate for total project costs would have had an immediate impact on reported revenue since it would have either increased or decreased the estimated progress toward completion.

Astute investors would have been tipped off about growing changes in estimates by reading the footnotes in First Solar’s 2014 10-K filing. When the company updated its estimates for total project costs in 2014, with one click of the mouse inside a spreadsheet, management immediately recognized an additional $40 million of sales (following a boost of $8.5 million in 2013). Moreover, since no additional costs were associated with this windfall revenue, gross profit and operating income increased by an equal amount.

POC accounting provides management with unusual latitude in its ability to pull forward revenue, but CA, an enterprise software company, took matters much further by pulling forward license revenue on multiyear licenses, which would not actually be earned for many years to come.

### Accounting Capsule: Background on Percentage-of-Completion (POC)

POC revenue recognition allows companies to report revenue even before a project has been completed. It was introduced so that firms working on long-term construction-type contracts could report business activity each period even if a product was not delivered to the customer. Under this framework companies are expected to estimate the proportion of the project that has been completed and to recognize a pro rata share of the total project’s revenue, expenses, and profits. Investors should be extra vigilant when analyzing companies using percentage-of-completion accounting, since the reported results hinge on the company’s estimates about its own progress.

### Be Alert for Up-Front Recognition of a Long-Term License Contract

CA sold long-term licenses allowing customers to use its mainframe computer software. Customers paid an up-front licensing fee for the software, as well as an annual charge to renew the license in subsequent years. Despite the long-term nature of these agreements (some contracts lasted as long as seven years), the company would recognize the present value of all licensing revenue for the entire contract immediately. Since all licensing revenue was recorded at the beginning of the contract, and cash was not collected for many years to come, CA recorded substantial amounts of long-term receivables on its Balance Sheet.

### Regulators Also Strongly Disagreed with the Approach

The SEC charged that from January 1998 through October 2000, CA prematurely recognized over $3.3 billion in revenue from at least 363 software contracts with customers.

CA’s bulging long-term receivables should have alerted investors to the company’s aggressive revenue recognition. A careful review would have alerted investors to the firm’s surging long-term and total receivables as early as September 1998. Investors should use a measure called “days’ sales outstanding” (DSO) to evaluate how quickly customers are paying their bills relative to how quickly revenue is recorded. A higher DSO could indicate more aggressive revenue recognition in addition to simply poor cash management. With the company’s long-term installment receivables soaring at September 1998, its DSO reached 247 days (based on product revenue)—a year-over-year increase of 20 days. Furthermore, total receivables, including both current and long term, increased to 342 days—a jump of 31 days.

## 3. Recording Revenue Before the Buyer’s Final Acceptance of the Product

In the first two sections of this chapter, we focused on the seller’s performance of its obligations under the contract. In the next two sections, we shift our focus to the buyer. This section deals with three types of tricks that produce revenue before final acceptance by the buyer, specifically, recording revenue (1) before shipment of product to the buyer, (2) after shipment but to someone other than the buyer, and (3) after shipment but while the buyer still could void the sale.

### Seller Records Revenue Before Shipment

One problematic and often controversial method of revenue recognition involves so-called bill-and-hold arrangements. With this approach, the seller bills the customer and recognizes revenue but continues to hold the product. For most sales, revenue recognition requires shipment of the product to the customer. In certain cases, however, accounting guidelines allow revenue to be recognized under bill-and-hold transactions, provided that the customer requests this arrangement and is the main beneficiary. For example, if the buyer does not have adequate storage space, it may ask the seller to hold on to the purchased goods as a courtesy. Under no circumstances can early recognition of revenue occur under a bill-and-hold arrangement if the arrangement is initiated by the seller for the benefit of the seller (i.e., to record revenue at an earlier date).

### Watch for Bill-and-Hold Transactions Initiated by the Seller

If it seems like the seller has initiated a bill-and-hold transaction, investors should assume that the seller has attempted to recognize revenue too early. For example, Sunbeam CEO Al Dunlap used a bill-and-hold strategy to make the company’s financial performance appear better than it really was by artificially inflating Sunbeam’s revenue.

Sunbeam, anxious to boost sales in its “turnaround year,” hoped to convince retailers to buy grills nearly six months before they were needed. In exchange for major discounts and longer payment terms, retailers agreed to purchase merchandise that they would not physically receive until months later. In the meantime, the goods would be shipped out of the grill factory in Missouri to third-party warehouses leased by Sunbeam, where they would be held until the customers requested them.

Nonetheless, Sunbeam booked the sales and profits from all $35 million in bill-and-hold transactions. When outside auditors later reviewed the documents, they reversed a staggering $29 million of the $35 million and shifted the sales to future quarters. In doing the initial audit, Arthur Andersen had questioned the accounting treatment of some transactions. But in almost every case, it concluded that the amounts were “immaterial” to the overall audit. Sometimes detecting signs of aggressive accounting is close to impossible. In the case of Sunbeam, it required nothing more than reading the revenue recognition footnote in the company’s 10-K.

**SUNBEAM’S 10-K FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURE TOLD THE STORY**
> The Company recognizes revenues from product sales principally at the time of shipment to customers. In limited circumstances, at the customers’ request the Company may sell seasonal products on a bill-and-hold basis provided that the goods are completed, packaged and ready for shipment, such goods are segregated and the risks of ownership and legal title have passed to the customer. The amount of such bill-and-hold sales at December 29, 1997 was approximately 3 percent of consolidated revenues.

Eventually, Dunlap was fired when the board of directors realized that he had done little to improve the company’s financial situation and had simply used improper financial engineering to drive the stock price higher.

### Seller Records Revenue upon Shipment to Someone Other Than the Customer

Auditors often look to shipping records as evidence that the seller delivered its product to the customer, allowing revenue to be recorded. Management might attempt to trick its auditors (and its investors) into believing that a sale occurred by shipping products to someone other than the customer. Consider the case of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.

Part of Krispy Kreme’s revenue comes from selling doughnut-making equipment to its franchisees. It would certainly be appropriate for the company to record sales revenue upon shipment of a machine to a franchisee—provided, of course, that the machine was received by the franchisee. In 2003, Krispy Kreme went to great lengths to fool its auditors by pretending to ship equipment to franchisees. It shipped the equipment out, but to company-owned trailers to which the franchisees had no access. Krispy Kreme still recorded the revenue, even though the customers had failed to take possession of the machines shipped.

### Watch for Shipping Product to an Intermediary, Rather Than the Actual Customer

Sometimes a seller will ship out product to a reseller before a deal has been fully completed. Autonomy was one of the largest software companies in the United Kingdom until being acquired by HP. To juice its revenue, it would book sales on software deals still under negotiation with end users (but had not yet closed) and transfer the associated product to resellers, which in turn would take ownership immediately and hold on to the product until the sales process with the end user was finalized. In exchange for “stepping into the transaction” and allowing Autonomy to recognize revenue immediately, Autonomy paid commission rates (akin to a bribe) of up to 10 percent, even though the reseller had virtually no role in the underlying sales process and often did not even have any information about the status of the deals.

### Be Wary of Consignment Arrangements

Another technique for prematurely recording revenue at the point of shipment involves consignment sales. With such sales, the products are shipped to an intermediary, called a “consignee.” Think of the consignee as an outside sales agent who is given the task of finding a buyer. Normally the manufacturer (called the “consignor”) should recognize no revenue until the sales agent consummates a transaction with an end customer. Chainsaw Al Dunlap and his minion at Sunbeam, not surprisingly, ignored that standard and recorded $36 million in consignment sales before an end user had even been found.

### Who Is the Actual Customer—the Distributor or the End User?

Companies that sell products through a distribution network must decide whether to book sales when they ship to the distributor (“sell-in” approach), or later when the distributor sends goods to the actual user of the product (“sell-through” approach). While both approaches are widely used, the sell-through approach is considered more conservative, as it more directly aligns reported revenue with end-customer demand. More aggressive (and most concerning) is when a company switches from the more conservative sell-through to the sell-in approach, which of course inflates sales. We saw an example of such a change at Medicis, shortly after the company was acquired by Valeant in December 2012.

Valeant cleverly changed the existing revenue recognition policy at the newly acquired Medicis unit in the first quarter after the deal closed, so its sales would be recognized sooner and reported growth would be higher. Medicis sold product through its distributor, McKesson, which then sold it to physicians. Medicis historically used the more conservative sell-through approach, booking no sales until the distributor sold to the physicians. To goose sales at the Medicis unit after the deal closed, Valeant had Medicis immediately switch to the sell-in approach and started recognizing sales much earlier—when product was sent to the distributor. That brazen change in revenue recognition caught the attention of astute investors and eventually the SEC, which issued a formal letter of reprimand.

Medicis was not the only case of revenue shenanigans in Valeant’s M&A path. Salix, acquired by Valeant in early 2015, had a string of even more troubling shenanigans in dealings with distributors. In the last quarter of 2013 and the first three quarters of 2014, it aggressively “stuffed the channel,” meaning it shipped much more product to the distributors than they could sell to their customers. And by using the sell-in approach, Salix materially inflated its revenue. When the scheme was detected late in 2014, Salix was forced to restate its previously released financial statements to lower revenue and profits during each of these four quarters.

Since all these details were publicly disclosed in late 2014, we are completely baffled why Valeant would still have closed on the acquisition. (We will have more on this in Part Five.)

### Seller Records Revenue, but Buyer Can Still Reject the Sale

The final part of this section discusses revenue that is recorded prematurely even though product was shipped and received by the customer. This may occur if (1) the customer received the wrong product, (2) the customer received the correct product, but too early, or (3) the customer received the correct product at the right time but still reserves the right to reject the sale. When a buyer has received a product but can still reject the sale, the seller must either wait until final acceptance to record revenue or recognize the revenue but record a reserve estimating the amount of anticipated returns.

### Be Wary of Sellers Deliberately Shipping Incorrect or Incomplete Products

Sometimes companies scheme to inflate revenue by intentionally shipping the wrong product and recording the related revenue, although they know full well that the product will be returned. Symbol Technologies allegedly shipped incorrect product without customer approval in order to report higher sales. Similarly, at the end of the fourth quarter of 1996, Informix recorded revenue but failed to deliver the required software code prior to year-end. Then in January 1997, Informix delivered a beta version of the software that did not function properly with the hardware. It took the company another six months to deliver usable software code. As it turned out, Informix recorded revenue far too early in the fourth quarter of 1996 rather than when the company had satisfied its obligations in the third quarter of 1997.

### Be Alert to Sellers Shipping Product Before the Agreed-upon Shipping Date

The fiscal quarter is ending, and profits are sagging. What can a company do? Why not simply start shipping merchandise and recording revenue, thereby boosting sales and profits? Merchandise is rushed out of the warehouse to customers toward the end of the year (even before the sales have taken place), and sales revenue is recorded. Since under this method, revenue is recognized when an item is shipped to retailers or wholesalers, some manufacturers may be tempted to keep shipping their products during slow times—even if the retailers’ shelves are overstocked. Automobile manufacturers have been doing this for years, thereby artificially increasing their sales. By shipping a product late in a quarter, rather than during the following quarter when a customer expects to receive it, a seller can improperly record revenue too soon. An increase in DSO can often be an indicator that more products were shipped late in a quarter than usual.

Even if a company ships its products to the actual customer and the customer receives them, the company still may not be permitted to recognize revenue. The final hitch involves terms in many contracts that give the customer the right to return the products within a certain period of time.

### Be Mindful of Sellers Recording Revenue Before the Lapse of the Right of Return

Many businesses permit the buyer a “right of return” if the customer is not satisfied with the goods. In those cases, companies are required to either delay revenue recognition until the right of return lapses or estimate the amount of expected returns and reduce revenue by that amount. If the actual level of returned products is more than the company’s initial estimates, the company may be guilty of having recognized too much revenue up front.

## 4. Recording Revenue When the Buyer’s Payment Remains Uncertain or Unnecessary

Continuing our focus on the buyer, we turn our attention to the revenue recognition requirement concerning customer payment. The seller may be accelerating revenue recognition if it records sales when the buyer lacks the ability to pay (payment remains uncertain) or when the seller aggressively induces the sale by not requiring the customer to pay until long after the sale (payment remains unnecessary).

### Buyer Lacks the Ability or the Necessary Approval to Pay

In earlier sections, we discussed the requirement that the seller complete its obligations and the requirement that a buyer convey final acceptance. At Kendall Square Research Corporation, a computer systems maker in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of that took place—the product was shipped, and the customer accepted it. The final question was whether the customer had the wherewithal and the intention to pay. Many of Kendall Square’s customers—mainly universities and research institutions—required a third party to provide the funds. In truth, the sale was contingent on the receipt of outside funding, and thus no revenue should have been recognized until such funding had been secured. Kendall Square must have been aware of those contingencies, since it was later revealed that the company had provided customers with “side letter” agreements that essentially voided the sales if the customers failed to receive funding.

A shareholder lawsuit charged that nearly half of Kendall Square’s reported revenue in the first quarter of 1993 had been improperly booked. Most of this revenue came from shipments to the University of Colorado and the Applied Computer Systems Institute of Massachusetts before these customers had received sufficient funding. The company eventually restated its financial statements for fiscal 1992 and the first half of 1993, reversing approximately half of its previously reported revenue.

### Watch for Companies That Change Their Assessment of Customers’ Ability to Pay

Management’s assessment of a customer’s ability to pay is what determines the estimates used to account for uncollectible receivables. Changes in these assessments may provide companies with a nonrecurring boost to revenue. Consider the revenue recognition policy change made by software company Openwave Systems in December 2005.

Openwave initially waited until the receipt of cash before recognizing any revenue from “deadbeat” customers that it feared might not pay. Under a new policy, Openwave could recognize revenue immediately, simply by concluding that the customer no longer was a deadbeat.

Investors who noticed this subtle change by management would have recognized that Openwave’s business was actually growing more slowly than reported. Openwave’s change in policy indeed reflected its desperation. Revenue growth slowed dramatically in the following years, and Openwave’s stock price, which spent much of the March 2006 quarter above $20, plummeted to $6 in July. Diligent investors who reviewed the company’s December 2015 10-Q would have easily spotted this change in the revenue recognition footnote, as shown below. However, investors who relied only on the company’s quarterly Earnings Release and conference call may have missed the boat, as those disclosures made no mention of the change in accounting.

**OPENWAVE SYSTEMS REVENUE RECOGNITION CHANGE DISCLOSURE, 12/05 10-Q**
> As of the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company revised its policy regarding the determination factor for deferrals of revenue recognition for arrangements deemed not probable for collection. Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company continued to defer revenue recognition on arrangements originally deemed not probable for collection until the receipt of cash from that arrangement. As of the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company revised its policy such that revenue on arrangements previously deemed not probable for collection, which are subsequently deemed probable for collection, is recognized in the period of the change in the assessment of collectability, rather than upon receipt of cash, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. This change in policy did not have a material impact for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. [Italics added for emphasis]

### Seller Induces Sale by Allowing an Exceptionally Long Time to Pay

Rather than using a third-party institution for financing, some cash-strapped customers use financing provided by the seller itself. Investors should be cautious about seller-provided financing arrangements (including very generous extended payment terms), as they may indicate the acceleration of revenue into the current period, tepid customer interest in the product, or the buyer’s lack of ability to pay.

### Watch for Seller-Provided Financing

To accelerate revenue in recent years, a number of high-tech companies have lent money to customers to enable them to pay for their products. In moderation, customer financing can be considered a sound selling technique; when it is abused, however, it can be a dangerous way to do business. When the dot-com bubble burst, the amount of financing provided by telecommunication equipment suppliers to their customers should have made investors nervous. At the end of 2000, these suppliers were collectively owed as much as $15 billion by customers, a 25 percent increase in a single year.

### Watch for Companies That Offer Extended or Flexible Payment Terms

Sometimes companies offer sweet payment terms to entice their customers to purchase additional products earlier than normal. While offering favorable payment terms to customers may be a completely appropriate business practice, it may also add a level of uncertainty to the eventual collectibility of receivables. Moreover, even when extending terms to creditworthy customers, overly generous terms may effectively shift sales that originally were slated for future periods into the current one. This shift would allow for unsustainably high near-term revenue growth and produce pressure to fill the void created in that later period.

### Sound the Alarm When New Extended Payment Terms Are Disclosed and DSO Jumps

Investors should be particularly concerned about accelerated (or even improper) revenue recognition when a company begins extending very generous payment terms and DSO spikes, as shown in Table 3-3. The deck materials supplier Trex Company, for example, provided extended payment terms to customers under what it called an “early buy program” in late 2004 and early 2005. As demand declined, it seemed that Trex enticed customers to accept products earlier than normal (without having to pay for them). This arrangement had minimal impact on the buyers’ total purchases but allowed Trex to record revenue in an earlier period. Astute analysts would have surmised that extended payment terms were needed to avoid reporting disappointing sales growth. Several months later, Trex announced that its revenue for June 2005 would be much lower than Wall Street expectations. Trex’s sharp increase in receivables, together with the company’s disclosure of extended payment terms and an early buy program, should have alerted investors to the coming slowdown in sales growth.

More recently, investors in San Francisco–based Fitbit were jolted during the company’s November 2016 conference call when management suddenly lowered guidance for future sales growth by a stunning 15 percent. To put that in some perspective, in Q4 2015 sales grew 92 percent, and now the sales growth estimate in Q4 2016 would be only 2 to 5 percent. Yikes!

That announcement by management marked the end of a period of hypergrowth fueled by new fitness tracking products and geographic expansion. But were there no warnings for investors that business was really starting to struggle? Indeed, signs of a weakening business (obscured by shenanigans) could be found in the second-quarter earnings conference call. In his remarks, the CFO mentioned in passing that Fitbit had just extended payment terms to “certain customers in Asia Pac [Pacific], due to the channel inventory levels previously discussed.” In that one cryptic sentence, management signaled serious business challenges in Asia, which had been covered up by offering distributors there more time to pay. As is often the case when business problems are being covered up by management, the deceptions tend to work only for a short period; sure enough, by December 2016, unsuspecting investors were stunned as Fitbit’s stock collapsed 50 percent.

## Looking Ahead

This chapter addressed accounting tricks involving mainly legitimate sources of revenue. Chapter 4 describes a more sinister transgression: recording bogus or fictitious revenue.
